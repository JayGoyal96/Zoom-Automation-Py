# Zoom-Automation-Py
> This is a very basic python code which automates the process of joining and leaving the zoom meetings.

## Requirements
> Put a random zoom link in your browser address bar and hit enter. Make sure to check this box and click open so you don't have to do it again and again after automating.

> Make sure to disable this 'ask for confirmation while you exit a meeting' box in your zoom settings.

> Always give time in 24hr format inside data.py.
